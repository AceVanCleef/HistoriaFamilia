# Game Concept Ideas

## Unit Types
- Archers: Can walk and shoot.
- Siege weapons: Either walk or shoot. Open question: Can they counter attack?
  - Siege unit's state cycle has to be ajusted so that they either have to attack or move, but when moved they can no longer attack.
- Cavalery archers: highly mobile, ranged units.
- Knights (cavalery units): hevaily armored units.
- Cavalery scouts: lighter armor, more mobility, larger scouting range in fog of war.

## Unit Production
- Barracks: recruit and train a unit. Training will last e.g.  2 rounds.
