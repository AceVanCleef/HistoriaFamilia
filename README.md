# Historia Familia  
Historia Familia is an educational project made by two computer science students during the spring semester 2018.
After two days of designing and two weeks of programming a turn based strategy game for the first time, we finally reached the stage of an intractive, but not yet really playable prototype. Some major functionalities such as a turn manager or AI acting as your enemy are still missing. The lessons learned while working on this project are invaluable towards future endeavors.

## Story:
"Your recently deceased grandfather left behind a heirloom: Your familyâ€™s history documented in
an old looking book. Your curiosity sparks and you start to read. While reading, you slowly fall
asleep and suddenly, you are in the middle of that battle your grand, grand, grand father had
fought: The defense of the kingdom you live in even today against a mysterious aggressor.""

# Known Issues (TBD)
- Improve map tile highlighting when moving, attacking or hovering with mouse, making them more distinct.
- Rarely, the mouse Cursor throws an error for not being instantiated.
- allied units shouldn't be able to walk through hostile units.
- While a unit is LERPing, a player can click on attack and gets the tiles in attack range from where the unit has been in that instant.
- If a player ends his turn by attacking a hostile unit, the attacked unit ends up being the selected unit of the next player.
- HP text of units is hardly visible.



# Dev Log
See videos about the development process, how the game progresses over time and what it has turned into until we had to hand it in at the end of the semester. This game might never be finished but it is interesting to see how much effort it goes into making it. Everything was programmed by ourselves, tutorials and guides consulted about how to do X or Y in Unity and the web browsed for place holder assets.


### 01 Generate units from Unity's inspector
In Unity it is possible to define units (of your army) from the inspector. This simplifies the creation of more unit types in the future.

### 02 Boolean flag based unit state machine in action
A unit follows a state cycle that regulates what it can do in any moment.

Two players can now fight for dominance.
