# Historia Familia  
Historia Familia is an educational project made by two computer science students during the spring semester 2018.
After two days of designing and two weeks of programming a turn based strategy game for the first time, we finally reached the stage of an intractive, but not yet really playable prototype. Some major functionalities such as a turn manager or AI acting as your enemy are still missing. The lessons learned while working on this project are invaluable towards future endeavors.

## Story:
"Your recently deceased grandfather left behind a heirloom: Your family’s history documented in
an old looking book. Your curiosity sparks and you start to read. While reading, you slowly fall
asleep and suddenly, you are in the middle of that battle your grand, grand, grand father had
fought: The defense of the kingdom you live in even today against a mysterious aggressor.""

# Dev Log
See videos about the development process, how the game progresses over time and what it has turned into until we had to hand it in at the end of the semester. This game might never be finished but it is interesting to see how much effort it goes into making it. Everything was programmed by ourselves, tutorials and guides consulted about how to do X or Y in Unity and the web browsed for place holder assets.


### Generate units from Unity's inspector
In Unity it is possible to define units (of your army) from the inspector. This simplifies the creation of more unit types in the future.

### Boolean flag based unit state machine in action
A unit follows a state cycle that regulates what it can do in any moment.
